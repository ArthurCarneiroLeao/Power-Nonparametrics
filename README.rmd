# Power-Nonparametrics
In statistical inference, we develop hypothesis testing over a distribution by using a test statistic.  
With the aim to compare the performance of the test statistic T in the following hypotheses, we generate data from 4 different distributions :

  - Normal(0.5,1);
  
  - Exponential(2);
  
  - Uniform(0,1);
  
  - Cauchy(0.5,1).
