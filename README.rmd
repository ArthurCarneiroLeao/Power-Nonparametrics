# Power-Nonparametrics
In statistical inference, we develop hypothesis testing over a distribution by using a test statistic.  
With the aim to compare the performance of the test statistic T in the following hypotheses, we generate data from 4 different distributions :

  -Normal;
  -Exponential;
  -Uniform;
  -cauchy.
