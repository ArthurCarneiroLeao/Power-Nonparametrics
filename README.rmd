# Power-Nonparametrics
In statistical inference, we develop hypothesis testing over a distribution by using a test statistic.  
With the aim to compare the performance of the test statistic T in the following hypotheses, we generate data from 4 different distributions:

$\begin{itemize}
  \item a
  \item b
\end{itemize}$
